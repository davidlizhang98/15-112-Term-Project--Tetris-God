added significant AI features

added functions that calculate all the necessary characteristics of the board
that need to be considered to evaluate what a "good" move is

implemented a findBestPlacement function which determines what the best move 
would be, given the current falling piece and the piece available from the
hold

implemented a doAIMove function which incrementally does the steps of the
ideal move one at a time and displays each step of the move to the user

completed a fundamental AI that is capable of clearing hundreds of lines
before topping out (a.k.a. losing; highest score was in the 1100s)
