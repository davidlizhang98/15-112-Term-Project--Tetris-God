I want to build upon the version of Tetris that we developed in class to make it a smoother version that has a 
higher skill cap.

I want to develop a Tetris AI with varying levels of difficulty that a player can practice against or just spectate
to learn strategies for playing the game effectively. 

I want to implement a multiplayer version of the game where 2 players can interact with each other by sending 
cleared lines to one another (eventually causing one another to lose by forcing a top out). If I have time, I would
like to make a WebApp version of the game.

Modules:
pygame (for the game itself)
possibly Django (for the WebApp if I get to it)
